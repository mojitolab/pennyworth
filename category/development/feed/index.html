<p>ASP.NET can be an incredibly useful tool when you&#8217;re developing web applications. This tool provides a programming model as well as a structure for software.

<h2>It Has A Long History</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2600" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LongHistory.png" alt="Long History" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LongHistory.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LongHistory-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LongHistory-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>ASP.NET has been around since 2002, which means there is a wealth of information about it online. Although this tool has gone through a number of changes over the years, its history means that it is effortless to find tutorials and community support if you have any issues.</p>

If you use ASP.NET, you&#8217;ll find that valuable information is always right at your fingertips. There are all sorts of resources that will be readily available to you.</p>
<h2>ASP.NET is Easy To Use</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2598" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EasyToUse.png" alt="ASP.NET is Easy To Use" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EasyToUse.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EasyToUse-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EasyToUse-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re relatively new to developing web applications, you won&#8217;t want to use a tool with a steep learning curve. One of the main reasons that ASP.NET has been so popular for so long is that it&#8217;s designed to be simple to use. A lot of tasks are easy to complete when you&#8217;re working with this tool.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/php-vs-net-exhaustive-comparison-two-popular-options-web-developers/">compare ASP.NET to similar web development tools</a>, you&#8217;ll be able to see the difference. It&#8217;s so simple to use, and working with this tool can save you a lot of time. Time is an incredibly valuable resource, especially in the world of web development, and an easy-to-use tool like this one can help you use that resource effectively.</p>
<h2>Excellent Performance</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2599" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ExcellentPerformance.png" alt="Excellent Performance" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ExcellentPerformance.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ExcellentPerformance-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ExcellentPerformance-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had performance issues with a web development tool, you know those kinds of problems can hinder your progress. While every tool has issues at one point or another, ASP.NET is known for its smooth performance. While you&#8217;re using this tool, you can expect minimal crashes and very little slow-down.</p>
<p>You need to make sure you&#8217;re using reliable tools when you&#8217;re developing your application. If you have a lot of issues with the development tools that you&#8217;re using, you could wind up losing a lot of your progress. You can count on <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/dot-net-development/">ASP.NET for web development</a> to work the way it&#8217;s supposed to.</p>
<h2>ASP.NET Gives Users A Great Deal Of Flexibility</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2603" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GreatDeal-Flexibility.png" alt="Great Deal Of Flexibility" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GreatDeal-Flexibility.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GreatDeal-Flexibility-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GreatDeal-Flexibility-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>There are plenty of different ways you can use this tool. Because of how it is designed, it&#8217;s easy for you to make changes on the fly. If you use ASP.NET, you won&#8217;t be locked into using your application in a specific way. You&#8217;ll have plenty of flexibility and can create the kind of app that you want to develop.</p>
<p>Some tools are very rigid, which means it is very difficult to make changes. This gives you less control over your finished app. When you use ASP.NET, you&#8217;ll have options and can make changes at any time. This means you&#8217;ll be proud of the final product that you build.</p>
<h2>It Has Advantages Over Similar Tools</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2602" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SimilarTools.png" alt="Advantages Over Similar Tools" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SimilarTools.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SimilarTools-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SimilarTools-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>There are a lot of tools available to people involved in web application development. However, most of these tools don&#8217;t have the level of stability that ASP.NET has. There is a reason that people have been using ASP.NET for web application development for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>Why do people keep going back to ASP.NET? If you use this tool and compare it against some of its top competitors, you&#8217;ll see that it offers plenty of distinct benefits. From early binding to fast collection, you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy all kinds of perks when you&#8217;re using this tool. It&#8217;s one of the top choices for web development.</p>
<h2>ASP.NET is a Popular Tool</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2601" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PopularTool.png" alt="ASP.NET is a Popular Tool" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PopularTool.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PopularTool-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PopularTool-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>Since ASP.NET is very popular, you&#8217;ll find a large community of people that use this tool. You&#8217;ll be able to interact with people in these communities and ask for advice and feedback if needed. You&#8217;ll always be able to connect with people that will be able to talk with you about this tool.</p>
<p>If you choose to use a less popular tool, you&#8217;re not going to have access to these kinds of communities. ASP.NET&#8217;s popularity makes it easy for you to ask questions and get additional information when you need it. Being a part of the right community might also help you to take full advantage of ASP.NET and everything that it&#8217;s capable of.</p>
<p>The advantages of using ASP.NET for web development are more than apparent. If you&#8217;re looking for the best app development tool, you can end your search now. You&#8217;ll be able to get a great deal out of this tool. If you use it, you&#8217;ll be able to build applications that you&#8217;ll be proud of. Take a closer look at ASP.NET to see if it&#8217;s right for you.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/advantages-of-using-asp-net-for-web-development/">Advantages of Using ASP.NET for Web Development</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com">Imenso Software</a>.</p>

<p>Software product development doesn&#8217;t have to be done in-house, and some of the largest companies in the world prefer outsourcing. It simplifies matters and makes it easier for those who want to focus on other aspects of their business.</p>



<span id="more-2581"></span>


<p>To understand the benefits of outsourcing and why it works so well, it&#8217;s time to think about the main reasons to <a href="/">outsource software product development</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a look at the benefits for modern businesses to head down this path instead of pursuing an in-house option.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Faster      </h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2590" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p><strong>You are going to have things done faster than ever before.</strong></p>
<p>The average business doesn&#8217;t have enough time throughout the week to spend on software product development. This means it becomes only a part of what the business does, and that&#8217;s not good enough. This is a significant project, and it has to be handled by someone willing to give it all form day one.</p>
<p>As a result, outsourcing becomes a go-to option that works well and continues to deliver results as you set the timeline. They will make sure to get the work done based on when you want it to be done.</p>
<h2>2. Reduced Cost</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2587" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reduce-cost.png" alt="Reduced Cost" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reduce-cost.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reduce-cost-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/reduce-cost-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of money on software product development?</strong></p>
<p>While you are going to be charged a fee for their services, it&#8217;s still going to be less than what you would have paid for an in-house alternative. Most people have to stop everything and use various tools to ensure the development goes ahead as planned. This is wasteful and is the last thing you want when it is time to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>By outsourcing, you can leverage what they already have and use it to your advantage. They will already know what to use and what to do, making it easier for you.</p>
<h2>3. Professional Assistance</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-2588 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ProfessionalAssistance.png" alt="Professional Assistance" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ProfessionalAssistance.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ProfessionalAssistance-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ProfessionalAssistance-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p>When you choose an outsourcing company like Imenso Software, you are going with someone that has a professionally trained development team. These are individuals that are going to be specialists in the world of software product development, making them an ideal solution for your needs. Instead of having to settle for inferior talent that isn&#8217;t going to keep up with your needs, why not go with the best outsourcing company?</p>
<p>You can go with someone that is willing to assist you every step of the way and is going to offer tremendous skills too. This is essential when it comes to managing software product projects.</p>
<h2>4. Global Talent Pool</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2589" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GlobalTalentPool.png" alt="Global Talent Pool" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GlobalTalentPool.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GlobalTalentPool-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GlobalTalentPool-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p><strong>Choosing from your city is okay, but it&#8217;s not the best use of what&#8217;s out there.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the world&#8217;s most exceptional talent is sitting outside the country, and it&#8217;s time to tap into it using the Internet. By having this open line of communication, you can hire almost anyone on the planet to take up the project. This means you can vet each agency, take a look at what they&#8217;re all about, and hire someone that is the best at what they do.</p>
<p>This makes it easier to end up with a software product that is worth your time and works the way you want it to.</p>
<h2>5. Latest Techniques</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2585" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LatestTechniques.png" alt="Latest Techniques" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LatestTechniques.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LatestTechniques-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LatestTechniques-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p>Using the latest techniques isn&#8217;t always possible with in-house solutions. You end up relying on techniques that are starting to age and may not be as effective as you want them to be.</p>
<p>By going with an outsourcer, you are trusting someone that does this for a living. They will know what to do and what to look for when it&#8217;s time to put together a new product.</p>
<p>This alone is beneficial as you hope to build something that is efficient and in line with your vision. The outsourcer will make sure this happens because of their technical prowess.</p>
<h2>6. Diversify Your Time</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2590" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime.png" alt="Diversify Your Time" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DiversifyYourTime-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p>As a business owner, you don&#8217;t want to be wasting time focusing on software product development. Yes, it is an integral part of your setup, but it&#8217;s not the only thing you want to think about. Instead, you want to move towards building a full-fledged enterprise that allows you to focus on other relevant details such as sales, marketing, or budgeting.</p>
<p>When you are laser-focused on one part of the business, everything else starts to stagnate.</p>
<p>This is why more and more businesses leave these projects to outsourcing company and work towards building a proper business.</p>
<h2>7. Reduced Risk</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2591" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Reduced-Risk.png" alt="Reduced Risk" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Reduced-Risk.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Reduced-Risk-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Reduced-Risk-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a reduction in risk by going with an outsourcer.</p>
<p>While they are not going to be in-house, you reduce the risk that is taken by investing in new tools. You can start to get more for less by choosing an outsourcer.</p>
<p>They are going to be willing to work hard for you because they&#8217;re working for a client. This is essential as you look to build something that is useful and is going to generate great results at the same time.</p>
<p>By going with something as simple as this, you take most of the risk off of your shoulders.</p>
<h2>8. Less Time Spent on Support</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-2584 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Time-Spent.png" alt="Less Time Spent on Support" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Time-Spent.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Time-Spent-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Time-Spent-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p>Imagine having to work on supporting the software product as it is being developed.</p>
<p>This is frustrating, and it can start to eat into your resources as you try to put together a legitimate enterprise. Many businesses have fallen apart because they don&#8217;t think about this angle.</p>
<p>You want to make sure most of the emphasis is put on a solution that is well-rounded and isn&#8217;t going to lean on your team providing support. It should be as simple as sitting back and letting the outsourcer take care of everything along the way.</p>
<p>This is when you&#8217;re going to be happy with the results.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>These are the main reasons to outsource software product development as you look to put together a comprehensive solution. The right option is going to be versatile, easy to manage, and in line with what software is supposed to be about. This is possible with the help of a quality company or provider that has years of experience working as an outsourcer. This alone is what makes it beneficial over the long-term.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/8-reasons-to-outsource-software-product-development/">8 Reasons to Outsource Software Product Development</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com">Imenso Software</a>.</p>

It is worth noting that the framework combines the best of other <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/best-web-development-frameworks-in-2019/">web frameworks</a>, including those implemented in different languages like Rails, Ruby, Sinatra, and ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>Laravel is a robust yet accessible framework that provides developers with a range of tools needed for robust and large applications. An expressive migration system, a tightly-integrated unit testing support, and a superb inversion of control container gives your <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/laravel-development/">Laravel development team</a> all the tools that they need to create/design all the applications you want.</p>
<p>Here is a look at why Laravel is currently the best PHP framework to work with:</p>

</ol>
<p><a name="authorization-techniques"></a></p>
<h3>1. Authorization Techniques</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2567 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AuthorizationTechniques-2.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AuthorizationTechniques-2.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AuthorizationTechniques-2-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AuthorizationTechniques-2-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>The framework simplifies the execution of authentication techniques. Almost everything in Laravel is extraordinarily configured. The program is the best option for developers looking for a more straightforward way to control access to resources and organizes their authorization logic.</p>
<p><a name="object-oriented-libraries"></a></p>
<h3>2. Object-Oriented Libraries</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2569 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Languages-Documented-1.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Languages-Documented-1.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Languages-Documented-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Languages-Documented-1-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>One of the main reasons why Laravel is the best PHP framework out there comes with Object-Oriented Libraries and other pre-installed ones that aren&#8217;t found on other PHP frameworks. A notable library that comes pre-installed in the program is the &#8220;Authentication Library&#8221;. This easy-to-implement library comes loaded with a ton of advanced features such as Cross-site Request Forgery protection, active users checker, encryption, password reset, and Bcrypt hashing.</p>
<p><a name="mvc-support"></a></p>
<h3>3. MVC Support</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2570 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mvc-support-2.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mvc-support-2.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mvc-support-2-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mvc-support-2-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>Another reason why this is the best PHP framework to work with is it supports different MVC Architectures such as Symfony, guaranteeing clarity between presentation and logic. MVC helps improve performance, has multiple built-in functionalities, and allows for better documentation.</p>
<p><a name="security"></a></p>
<h3>4. Security</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2578 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/security.png" alt="security" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/security.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/security-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/security-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>Web application development will often require that you use other technologies to ensure your application is secure. Laravel takes care of all things related to security within the framework. It uses salted and hashed passwords. As a result, your passwords are not saved as plain text within the framework&#8217;s database. It is also worth noting that the program uses the &#8220;Bcrypt hashing&#8221; set of rules to create encoded representations of passwords. The framework also uses SQL statements to make attacks impossible. The framework also provides simple ways to escape input from users to avoid the inoculation of tags.</p>
<p><a name="artisan"></a></p>
<h3>5. Artisan</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2574 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-5.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-5.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-5-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-5-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>Laravel comes with an in-built tool known as Artisan. When working with Laravel, developers normally interact with the program&#8217;s framework using an in-built command line that handles and creates the framework&#8217;s project environment. Artisan is Laravel&#8217;s command line management tool. Artisan performs most of those monotonous/repetitive programming tasks developers hate doing manually.</p>
<p><a name="database-migration"></a></p>
<h3>6. Database Migration</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2573 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-4.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-4.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-4-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-4-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>If there is one thing that most developers consider a pain, it is keeping the database synced between development machines. Laravel&#8217;s database migration is simple and easy to use. After spending hours on development, you will find that you&#8217;ve made lots of changes to your database and need to sync the information between your development machines. MySQL&#8217;s Workbench isn&#8217;t the best when it comes to syncing databases, and that is Migration comes into the picture. As long as you keep all your databases in migrations and seeds, you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem migrating the changes you make into any other development machine.</p>
<p><a name="responsible-interface"></a></p>
<h3>7. Responsible Interface</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2572 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-3.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-3.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-3-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-3-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>This relatively-new feature was added to the framework with the release of Laravel&#8217;s version 5.5. It&#8217;s a class that&#8217;s used to implement interfaces which can then be returned by using a method known as the controller method. This is then followed by the router checking for instances of Responsible when preparing &#8220;IlluminateRoutingRouter&#8221; responses.</p>
<p><a name="blade-templating-engine"></a></p>
<h3>8. Blade Templating Engine</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2568 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BladeTemplatingEngine-2.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BladeTemplatingEngine-2.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BladeTemplatingEngine-2-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BladeTemplatingEngine-2-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>Laravel&#8217;s Blade Templating Engine is quite intuitive and makes working with typical HTML and PHP spaghetti much easier, which is one of the qualities that makes this framework the best. If you ever need to chop up if statements that contain HTML, then you know what this means. With Blade Templating Engine, the process is made effortless.</p>
<p><a name="automation-package-discovery"></a></p>
<h3>9. Automation Package Discovery</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2571 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-2.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-2.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-2-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/scalable-2-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>In previous versions of Laravel, installing packages wasn&#8217;t that easy. However, newer versions after Laravel 5.5 comes with a feature known as Automatic Package Discovery which automatically detects packages users want to install. With newer versions of Laravel PHP framework, you do not have to set up any providers or aliases to install new packages. The framework also allows you to disable the feature if you do not want it running for specific packages.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/why-php-laravel-framework-is-the-best/">Why PHP Laravel Framework is the Best</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com">Imenso Software</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> So, before understanding which is a better programming language, it is essential to know why they are different. PHP is a server-side script. It is one of the most popular, mature, and ubiquitous scripts available on the web. On the other hand, Node.js is not a script at all. It’s one of the back-end development environment languages that use JavaScript. It is only because of JavaScript that you can call it a client-side script. In fact, it wasn’t until 2009 that Node.js could use JavaScript. </p>



<span id="more-2507"></span>


<h2>Front-end and Back-end Programming</h2>
<p>Back in 2009, when Node.js could start using JavaScript on the server-side, it fueled the rise of numerous sites that used JavaScript-powered stacks both in the front-end and back-end programming. That’s how back-end developers also came into the forefront. And, that’s also the reason why they can now weigh the differences between PHP and Node.js.</p>
<h2>Understanding PHP</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-2514 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php.png" alt="Understanding PHP" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p><a href="https://techterms.com/definition/php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypertext Preprocessor</a>, better known as PHP, is a regular scripting language that became the primary server-side language for web developers. PHP started way back in 1995, and web developers love it because of its modifications and latest updates. Most of the websites you see these days run on PHP. Its popularity is mainly due to the unanimous choice for various content management systems, such as Drupal, Joomla, and WordPress. Apart from these three traditional CMS structures, some of the modern frameworks also use PHP like CakePHP, Symfony, and Laravel.</p>
<h2>Understanding Node.js</h2>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-2512 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs.png" alt="Understanding Node.js" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h2>
<p>JavaScript has always been highly popular among web developers. This scripting language runs in a browser and helps to create interactive and dynamic web pages. However, after the transition of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> in 2009, you could also use JavaScript to perform asynchronous coding on the back-end. This runtime environment also became crucial because it has a plethora of frameworks available for web developers to choose from.</p>
<h3>Similarities between PHP and Node.js</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2513 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/phpnode-similarities.png" alt="Similarities between PHP and Node.js" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/phpnode-similarities.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/phpnode-similarities-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/phpnode-similarities-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>Web developers often become picky about the best back-end technology for a website. With PHP and Node.js going head to head, let’s take a look at some of their similarities first.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreted languages</strong></p>
<p>Well, there’s only one similarity between these two right now, and that’s the language they interpret. Node.js uses both JavaScript and PHP. These two are scripts or interpreted languages. You can run the code as-is even in their runtime environments. However, you need to use PHP for servers and JavaScript for browsers. Both JavaScript and PHP are incredible for newbie and veteran web developers.</p>
<h3>Differences between PHP and Node.js</h3>
<p>Although both Node.js and PHP are server-side languages, they have a few notable differences.</p>
<p><strong>1. Runtime Environments </strong></p>
<p>You can embed both PHP and Node.js directly into HTML. That’s the only similarity they have. But, when it comes to running the program, they both need different interpreters. Interpreters play a crucial role in the functioning of these two programming languages. PHP is widely known for being straightforward. You can install it in a flash and also use it on the server-side. Most importantly, it has a backing of Zend engine. That makes it even faster for web developers.</p>
<p>Node.js also works on a similar platform but has Google’s V8 JavaScript engine backing its performance. Remember that Node.js is only working on a runtime environment, supported by JavaScript that looks after the server-side of things.</p>
<p><strong>2. Simplicity </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to simplicity, development in PHP races ahead of Node.js. Conceptually, PHP is easier to understand and use. That is why experts recommend using PHP to new web developers. For example, you try to set up a server. You will not need some complicated programs and scripts; instead, all you require is a “.php” file along with some programming codes within tags, and that’s pretty much everything. You can enter the respective URL in the browser and hit enter. That’s it!</p>
<p>Web servers like MySQL, backed by PHP, interpret your file and simultaneously, displays it on the web page of your browser. On the other hand, it is slightly different to set up a Node.js server. Unlike PHP, it requires a little more of coding lines to execute the files in the browser. You also need a basic knowledge about callback functions and how closures work.</p>
<p><strong>3. Concurrency </strong></p>
<p>Most server-side programming languages use multi-threads. PHP is one of those languages. It blocks I/O from carrying out various multi-tasks simultaneously. Node.js slightly edges ahead of PHP on this one. It uses a handful of tricks like adding node clustering with event loop to achieve its objective of executing an event-driven program. It doesn’t necessarily block I/O execution models even if they use one primary thread for implementing the program.</p>
<p>However, since PHP is more mature, it has come up with a technique to tackle asynchronous processing. In fact, quite recently, it launched the HHVM project on Facebook, which was the start of testing the blocking and unblocking of I/O execution models.</p>
<p><strong>4. JSON </strong></p>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation or JSON comes with lightweight data format; something that keeps Node.js ahead of PHP when they have to deal with JSON. Although PHP can function when JSON is around, their operation is more situational. So, Node.js evens up the game when it comes with concurrency and JSON.</p>
<h3>When to use PHP?</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2517 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php-Copy.png" alt="When to use PHP?" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php-Copy.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php-Copy-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/php-Copy-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /> </h3>
<p>Most web developers, especially those working in the back-end, often ask when they should use PHP or Node.js. Well, here are some of the projects where <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/php-application-development/">PHP development</a> will save your day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software stacks, such as Apache, PHP, MySQL, and Linux. Everything that includes LAMP stack should have PHP as its backing.</li>
<li>Content management systems, such as Joomla, Drupal, WordPress, etc.</li>
<li>Servers, such as MariaDB, Sybase, Postgresql, Oracle, SQL, and MySQL, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to use Node.js?</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2518 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs-Copy.png" alt="When to use Node.js?" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs-Copy.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs-Copy-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nodejs-Copy-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<ul>
<li>When you are working with software stacks, such as MEAN stack, including Express.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS.</li>
<li>SPAs or Dynamic single-page applications.</li>
<li>Various front-end technologies, such as Backbone.js, AngularJS, ReactJS, Ember.js, and jQuery.</li>
<li>Server-side technologies, such as MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js,</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Node.js and PHP have their benefits and limitations, but selecting either of them depends on the project you are handling.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/php-vs-node-js-which-is-the-better-programming-language/">PHP vs Node.js &#8211; Which is the Better Programming Language?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.imensosoftware.com">Imenso Software</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress developers do most of their work in test environments. If you are a WordPress developer or a company offering <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/wordpress-development/">WordPress development services</a>, you need an excellent WordPress development tool. <span id="more-2493"></span>With hundreds of such tools out there, choosing the best WordPress development tool isn&#8217;t easy. Your research plays a big part in this regard. Your workflow will vary depending on the tool you pick. That&#8217;s why you need to know about the different WordPress development tools and what features they offer. Here are some of the best WordPress development tools on the market today.</p>
<h2>DesktopServer</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2500" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DesktopServer.png" alt="Desktop Server" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DesktopServer.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DesktopServer-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DesktopServer-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p>This is a Windows, and macOS tool will let you create multiple WordPress websites with a simple step-by-step wizard. You need to register to download the free version of this tool. This is one of the best development tools where ease of use is concerned. The tool will install all the software needed to power the development tool when you set it up for the first time. You only need to re-run the tool when you need to create or delete a WordPress site. You have the option of choosing which version of WordPress you need to install when using this tool. If you are looking for a simple tool without a lot of frills, this is the best WordPress development tool for you.</p>
<p>The features of the free version of the tool are limited to some extent. The most significant disadvantage of this software is it supports only a single type of web environment such as an Apache server operating PHP 5 and MySQL.

<p>

PHP an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most popular open-source scripting languages. It is not only easy to use, but it&#8217;s development tools offer speed and ease that transcends any other programming language.


</p>



<span id="more-2466"></span>


<div>
<p>Unlike other frameworks that do not have proper community support and documentation, PHP excels in all these while ideally providing well-strategized frameworks and scripts that are ready to implement. Apart from these appealing benefits, for an amateur or a developer with little to no technical knowledge, hypertext preprocessor is the best place to start.</p>
<p>What makes <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-PHP-differ-from-other-languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP different from other languages</a> is that it helps simplify and make the web application development process relatively easy. Yes, it&#8217;s being implemented for some of the most significant projects and has been in use for years, but it&#8217;s chiefly interesting because it is enhanced on a daily basis. If you&#8217;ve come across PHP 7, then you already know programmers are currently working on improving the performance of web apps.</p>
<p>Another exciting aspect is that all this is being achieved without increasing memory consumption. Ideally, this will allow developers to hasten the development of web apps and custom websites with ease by taking advantage of full-stack and lightweight PHP frameworks.</p>
<p>Enough about how excellent PHP is, let us look at some of the PHP development tools that any developer shouldn&#8217;t lack.</p>
</div>
<h2>Best PHP Development Tools</h2>
<div>
<h3>PHPStorm</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2480 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHPStorm.png" alt="PHP Storm" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHPStorm.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHPStorm-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PHPStorm-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>This is one of the top-rated PHP tools out there for developers, and it comes with the latest features that allow you to do your projects swiftly. PHPStorm is designed and promoted by JetBrains, one of the most reputed firms in PHP coding tools for developers.</p>
<p>PHPStorm works perfectly with essential PHP frameworks like Zend Studio, CakePHP, Symfony, <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/laravel-development/">Laravel</a>, Yii. Also, it supports primary content management systems like Magento, <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/wordpress-development/">WordPress</a>, and Drupal.</p>
<p>Any web development project can&#8217;t be complete without front end technologies, and that&#8217;s where PHPStorm comes into the picture. It paves the way for real-time editing of things like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, TypeScript, and many others. It ideally allows for code refactoring, unit testing as well as debugging.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Eclipse</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2476 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eclipse.png" alt="Eclipse" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eclipse.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eclipse-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eclipse-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>This is another popular PHP development tool, and that&#8217;s why it is one of the top in this list. Since it&#8217;s a fully developed PHP tool, it&#8217;s one of the most used integrated development environment that PHP provides. The most appealing thing about Eclipse is that it provides support to some of the most prominent operating systems like macOS, Linux, and Windows. Some of the tools that Eclipse offers make it easier to develop as well as simplify complex PHP applications. With this PHP development tool, you have the freedom to pick from a vast array of plugins. It ideally supports both GUI and non-GUI applications. This is one of those tools that allows you to utilize those plugins that help in customizing and extending the IDE to match the requirements of the project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>NetBeans</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2481 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NetBeans.png" alt="Net Beans" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NetBeans.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NetBeans-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NetBeans-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>This is another popular free PHP development tool that has rich features and enables multiple languages, including English, Russian and Portuguese. NetBeans free version goes back to 2010 when <a href="https://www.oracle.com/in/sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun Microsystems</a> initially created it. Oracle later took over it. Since it was launched, it has had a huge community of developers who are always working on an open-source environment.</p>
<p>Long gone are days when NetBeans had a reputation for being slow and just known for development in Java. Today, the tool is lightweight, fast, and supports the whole thing in PHP. It has the best support resources for all sorts for PHP frameworks such as Smarty Doctrine, Zend, Symfony2 and ideally, supports Laravel via Laravel-IDE-helper. Not just that, but NetBeans can enable support for frameworks such as WordPress, FuelPHP, CakePHP, and Yii.</p>
<p>Some of the attributes that keep NetBeans on top of this list are the code templates, quick fixes, smart code completion, and much more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Zend Studio</h3>

<p>This PHP development tool also makes it in this list due to its unparalleled speed compared to other tools. When utilizing Zend Studio, developers and programmers can enjoy the flexibility of writing as well as debugging code without having to put extra effort or time to accomplish the same. With this development tool, you can easily organize your application on multiple servers. It has ideally been designed to support PHP 7. Not only that, but it&#8217;s capable of code debugging in integration with X-debug, Zend Debuggers, and X-ray. Ideally, there&#8217;s a possibility of integration via Eclipse plugins.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Sublime Text 3</h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-2484 size-full" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SubLime.png" alt="Sublime Text 3" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SubLime.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SubLime-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SubLime-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></h3>
<p>This one gets a position in this list as it&#8217;s one of the sturdiest PHP text editors out there. It is lightweight with essential attributes and is supported on Windows, Linux, and OSX. Sublime Text 3 got its powers from various packages and plugins.</p>
<p>There are numerous PHP packages in the market that help in transforming this editor into an ideal PHP IDE. PHPDoc, PHPCS, and Sublime PHP companion are some of the most helpful packages to solve the purpose.</p>

<p> PHP has been a cornerstone of web development for a long time. The LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) is still a frequently used part of web development, and it is something that people tend to learn in computing courses in college. Today, there are many other frameworks that web applications can be built upon, but PHP is still popular, and still has much value. </p>



<span id="more-2437"></span>


<h2>Frameworks and Web Development</h2>
<div>
<p><img class="mb2 alignnone wp-image-2446 size-full" title="Frameworks and Web Development" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/framworkPHP.jpg" alt="" width="824" height="400" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/framworkPHP.jpg 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/framworkPHP-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/framworkPHP-768x373.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" />A framework is a collection of languages, libraries, and design patterns that come together to make it as easy as possible to build a web application. PHP is just one part of a framework, the programming language that everything else is built upon.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the distinction between Core PHP and the PHP framework, and why does it matter in modern web development?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Core PHP</h3>
<p><img class="mb2 alignnone wp-image-2448 size-full" title="Core PHP" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/core-php.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/core-php.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/core-php-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/core-php-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" />Core PHP is a simple, bare-bones <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP programming language</a>. It can be used to create web applications, and the beauty of it is that it is easy to set up and get running. You don&#8217;t need to install extra libraries. Core PHP is just &#8220;plain old PHP.&#8221; It&#8217;s pure PHP, with no confusing extras.</p>
<p>To build a sophisticated dynamic web application in Core PHP, you would need to understand programming principles very well. This is both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>In some ways, building out a fully fleshed out application in Core PHP may mean &#8216;reinventing the wheel. There are a lot of useful functionalities built into the language, but it is not something that has everything already done for you. This means you have more control, but in some ways, it also means more work. Also, because some things are done from scratch, Core PHP puts a lot more into the developer&#8217;s hands, and the code that is produced may be more &#8216;personal&#8217;, and harder for another external developer to dive in and work on right away.</p>
</div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<div>
<h3>PHP Framework</h3>
<p><img class="mb2 alignnone wp-image-2401 size-full" title="PHP Framework" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" />PHP Framework, on the other hand, is PHP with additional libraries and functionalities. This means that a lot of common, often repeated tasks are more comfortable to do in PHP Framework because there are already things in place to let you do them with a few lines of code.</p>
<p>PHP Framework is more standardized, so it is harder to write bad code. This means less time wasted on <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/debugger.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debugging</a>, and it means that when you bring an external developer into work on something they can tell at a glance what is going on.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>MVC Makes Things Easier</h2>
<p><img class="mb2 alignnone wp-image-2403 size-full" title="MVC Makes Things Easier" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" />For very small applications, Core PHP makes it easy to throw together some code, with minimal setup required. For more significant applications, this is not a good idea because it means that the code turns into a long, monolithic, and confusing document. The MVC model makes it a lot easier to write quality, robust code, by separating the logic from the style.</p>
<p>MVC stands for Model, View, Controler. With this way of working, you can change how an application looks without having to change the backend code. It can feel like a longwinded way of doing things at first, but the more significant the application gets the clearer the benefits of this way of working become.</p>
<p>Frameworks offer a standardized way of doing things that are understood by the whole industry. They make it easier to do complex projects and offer a lot of useful debugging and management features, as well as labor-saving features for often-repeated tasks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why Do People Still Use Core PHP?</h2>
<p><img class="mb2 alignnone wp-image-2451 size-full" title="Why Do People Still Use Core PHP?" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/steel-use.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/steel-use.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/steel-use-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/steel-use-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" />If Frameworks are so good, then why do people still use Core PHP?</p>
<p>Well, Core PHP is useful to learn because it provides people with a foundation for coding that allows them to work on any of the leading frameworks that are out there. Core PHP teaches you the absolute basics, and it teaches you how tounderstand what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong when you&#8217;re developing using a Framework, it helps if you understand PHP at the most detailed level, because you can trace through what is happening step by step.</p>
<p>Core PHP is useful when you&#8217;re dealing with performance constraints as well, since you can choose every library yourself and control precisely what is happening on the server, rather than having &#8216;too much&#8217; going on at once.</p>
<p>Core PHP is useful for truly custom web development. The developer has more control over the code, and this can be a perk if the application needs to have its optimized performance line by line.</p>
<h2>Which Should You Choose for Your Application?</h2>
<p><img class="mb2 alignnone wp-image-2406 size-full" title="Which Should You Choose for Your Application?" src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable.png" alt="" width="824" height="300" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" />If you&#8217;re not sure what to use for your application, consider how sophisticated it is, what server it will be running on, and how many users it will have. All of these things matter when it comes to optimizing your code.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/php-application-development/">PHP development team in India</a> is well versed in Core PHP and can also recommend PHP Frameworks that can suit most applications, and we would be happy to sit down and discuss the options with you to help you figure out the best choices for your site or application, depending on load.</p>
<p>For the end-user, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the application is running on, as long as it was an appropriate choice. The average web user has not heard of Laravel or Symfony, for example. All they care about is that they can log on to the website and get their work done, play their game, or message their friends. When things work seamlessly, people forget that there is any work being done at all.</p>
<p>We can help you with website and <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/services/web-development/">web application development</a> using a range of frameworks, or in Core PHP. Based on your specifications, we will suggest a framework that will help you to get the job done, or build out everything you need from scratch. The choice of development tools matters, but the most important thing is the code, and a good developer can use almost any language or framework to get the job done.</p>

<p>

PHP is a coding language that is widely used for the development of both websites and web applications.&nbsp; There are many reasons why PHP is a popular language and is the one you should look at for web development.&nbsp; Knowing what these reasons are will help you determine if this is a language that you need to know and use.&nbsp;

</p>



<span id="more-2390"></span>



<h2> The Simplicity </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP10.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2272" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP10.jpg 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP10-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP10-768x373.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

One of the significant benefits of PHP is the fact that the language is simple.&nbsp; Coding in PHP is like writing an essay in English that the computer is going to read.&nbsp; Unlike other coding languages, you will very rarely hear someone complain about the complexity of coding with PHP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The simplicity of the language also makes it easier for everyone to understand what is happening in the back end of a website or application.&nbsp; This can make amendments and adjustments much easier to complete.&nbsp; As the language is relatively simple, you will also have a larger talent pool available to you.&nbsp;

</p>



<h2> The Performance </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP5.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2266" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP5.jpg 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP5-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP5-768x373.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Performance is something that you always need to keep in mind with web development.&nbsp; Research has found that most users will leave a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.&nbsp; It is important to note that some users will leave before this as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, PHP ensures that your web applications will run quickly and smoothly.&nbsp; Code that runs on PHP will be faster than ASP, and you can make use of the JIT engine.&nbsp; The JIT engine compiles the coding into a machine language that is easier for devices to read. &nbsp;</p>



<p>PHP coding will also require fewer system resources.&nbsp; This is important because it does not slow servers down and makes the overall loading speed slower.&nbsp; The device that views the website will also not be affected by the content and forced to slow down some of its operations.&nbsp;

</p>



<h2> The Compatibility </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP7.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2268" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP7.jpg 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP7-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Outsourcing_PHP7-768x373.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

There are a few operating systems on the market, and you need to choose a language that is compatible with all of them.&nbsp; PHP is one of these languages as it will work seamlessly with all of the major operating systems, including Solaris and Linux.&nbsp; The compatibility of the language does not stop there as you also have wide-ranging compatibility with web servers and databases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>PHP will also support a lot of the commonly used protocols such as POP3, HTTP, and LDAP COM.&nbsp; This is vital when developing websites and web applications because specific protocols will work better for a project than others.&nbsp; Some other languages have limited compatibility with databases and protocols, and you need to consider this.&nbsp;

</p>



<h2> Easy Maintenance </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2401" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maintenance-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

This benefit of PHP is linked to the simplicity of the language and will impact the overall flexibility of the coding.&nbsp; Changes can easily be made to the coding at any point during development.&nbsp; This means that new features and functionality can be added at any time even after all of the code has been written.&nbsp; It is also possible to amend the existing code to enhance the features and functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ability to do this will make a website and web application maintenance much easier.&nbsp; This can be added to the fact that it is easy to find errors in the coding.&nbsp; Once found, they can easily be fixed, and the application or website can continue to run optimally.&nbsp;

</p>



<h2> Scalability </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2406" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scalable-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

PHP is the language being used by many high traffic websites and web applications.&nbsp; There is no limit on the type of website or web application which can be built with the language.&nbsp; This makes it one of the best languages to use if you want a website or app that is scalable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to scalability, it is important to note that PHP code can be embedded into HTML.&nbsp; This allows for the creation of simple and small websites which can grow.&nbsp; Various PHP frameworks can then be used to create a larger and more complicated application.&nbsp; These frameworks will make the creation of these applications faster, which means that you can scale at a quicker rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The simplicity and flexibility of the language also make it easier to scale.&nbsp; You can add what you need to increase the capacity of a web application without having to start over again.&nbsp; You can also amend any issues that arise from the increased use of the application or the increase in traffic. &nbsp;

</p>



<h2> Open Source </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2403" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/openSource-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Another reason why you should look at PHP for all of your web development is the fact that it is an open source language.&nbsp; This is important because it reduces the overhead costs that you can face.&nbsp; You will not have to worry about paying for licenses to use the language for your website or applications.&nbsp; This is something that you need to do with certain languages, and the costs can be relatively high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The open source nature of the language also increases the support that you get.&nbsp; Open source software and languages have great communities around them who help each other.&nbsp; This means that if you have a problem with your website or application, you can ask someone for a solution. &nbsp;

</p>



<h2> Object Orientated Language </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ool.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2404" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ool.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ool-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ool-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Object Orientated Language is an advantage of PHP that you should not overlook.&nbsp; This can help to reduce the lines of code that you need through the reuse of classes.&nbsp; PHP can reuse other language classes which have been written in Windows COM or Java objects.&nbsp; You will also be able to create custom classes with PHP.</p>



<p>A custom class is important because it is a class that other ones can borrow from.&nbsp; This will increase the capabilities of PHP and make it even more versatile. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a lot of coding languages out there, and you need to choose the right one for your website or web application.&nbsp; PHP is a commonly used language which is open source and easy to learn.&nbsp; It is also effortless to maintain and offers the speed and scalability that you might need.&nbsp; PHP is also compatible with all major operating systems and a wide range of databases and protocols.<br>To know more about our PHP development services, visit the link below:<a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/php-application-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/php-application-development/</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Due to the fact that pretty much every business now needs an online presence, they also need those who can work with back-end development. This is as true for working with mobile apps as it is with websites. This makes those who have the skills necessary to work with programming tools like Python or PHP in great demand. Here we will help those wanting to get started to understand the differences between Python vs PHP.</p>



<span id="more-2347"></span>



<p>When someone is just getting started as a developer, they are often unsure exactly which programming language would be the best when working with a back-end framework. They each have their positive and negative points, and several of them have good features, frameworks, and libraries, and this makes it challenging to know which one would be best to get started with. Since two of the most popular languages for this type of work are Python and PHP, we will do a comparison of these.

</p>



<h2>How Do These Languages Perform In Comparison? </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2355" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>When getting started, one of the big points would be which one is easier to learn. Most people would agree that Python is considerably easier than PHP. This means that for most new developers, Python will be a better choice to get started. In fact, this particular language is so much easier than many others that it is the language of choice for most starter courses that teach programming. The programs that someone will start off writing in this language will be easier and shorter than they would be with other languages. The code is more readable, and the syntax is simpler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PHP was designed to be used in many different situations and as a general-purpose programming language. It has a high level of sophistication, but this means that it will take longer to learn. There are quite a few beginner programmers and developers that try to start with PHP and find that it&#8217;s too complicated. In fact, when someone learns a more comfortable language like Python, then after gaining some experience, they find it easier to learn a more complex language like PHP.</p>



<p>The community that serves<a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/hire-developers/hire-php-developers/"> developers working with PHP</a> are trying to offer enough support. However, because Python is so much easier for beginners to learn, it is usually the best choice. Very often, someone just getting started in the field finds that it&#8217;s easier when they choose the right language, to begin with. </p>



<p></p>



<h2>How Well Are These Languages Documented? </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy.png" alt=" How Well Are These Languages Documented?" class="wp-image-2357" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>The documentation provided for both of these languages is quite excellent. There are large numbers of forums and discussion boards as well as independent websites that all provide tutorials and support for these languages. The communities typically compete with one another, and this means that there is lots of information out there and much of it is quite good. Overall, both of these languages would get a high rating on their documentation. </p>



<p></p>



<h2>Is There Any Cost Involved With These Two Languages? </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy-Copy-1.png" alt="Is There Any Cost Involved With These Two Languages? " class="wp-image-2361" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy-Copy-1.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy-Copy-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web_hosting-Copy-Copy-Copy-1-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Because both of these languages are open source, they are free. This means they are both winners with respect to price. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than free. Both of these languages are often better and more sophisticated than some of the frameworks that need to be paid for. This is another point that makes both of these languages winners. </p>



<p></p>



<h2>How Do They Compare In Speed? </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maganto_upgrade-Copy.png" alt=" How Do They Compare In Speed?" class="wp-image-2352" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maganto_upgrade-Copy.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maganto_upgrade-Copy-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maganto_upgrade-Copy-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Some of the old versions of PHP were pretty slow, but the newer versions are very fast. The newest versions are much faster than a usual Python program. For some applications, performance is critical. If a site gets hundreds of thousands or millions of hits every day, they then have a faster program could impact overall performance. For that reason, PHP wins by a fair margin when it comes to speed.</p>



<p> </p>



<h2>Which Of These Has Better Library Support? </h2>



<p>Python comes out a clear winner over PHP when it comes to library support. Its Library support is very well-developed for pretty much every application. Big organizations are using some of the machine learning applications provided by Python. Python has come out with several that are excellent. They are fast, and most are very easy to use. They can integrate easily with a web framework.&nbsp; </p>



<p></p>



<h2>Which One Is Better At Debugging? </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/not_evaluating-1.png" alt=" Which One Is Better At Debugging?" class="wp-image-1844" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/not_evaluating-1.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/not_evaluating-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/not_evaluating-1-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Both of these programming languages have substantial debugging capabilities. Neither one of these stand out from the other or is a clear winner. PDB is the debugger Python uses, and XDebug is what PHP uses. They both work very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>

When considering which of these languages to get started with, it is crucial to understand that both are very strong.&nbsp; Each of these languages can be very useful in a wide range of applications. They both have very large and involved communities that can help someone who is just getting started. A developer will be in high demand regardless of which of these they choose to start with.

</p>



<p>The most significant consideration that a new developer might consider, however, is how difficult the language will be first to learn. Python has such a wide range of applications and is considerably easier to learn than PHP, and that is why many people consider it to be the best first language to start with. After a developer gains some experience, then they may well want to add <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/technologies/php-application-development/">PHP web development</a> to their skill sets. <br>If someone has already gained some experience with PHP, then they should stick with it until they are a true expert. A big mistake that some people make is to jump from one program language to the next. They get to be a basic user of a particular program language, and then they move on to the next one. Some developers seem to think that if they know a little bit about several languages that it will make them more valuable. </p>



<p>If someone hasn&#8217;t learned any programming language, then Python is by far the easiest get started with. If, on the other hand, someone has already started with PHP and they have a basic understanding of using that language then it would be better for them to continue learning to be more of an expert with it then to jump to another language. In the end, both of these languages will be very useful for a programmer or developer to learn.

<p> Frameworks have proven to be an indispensable part of the web development mix. As web application standards continue to rise, so does the complexity of the tech needed. However, it makes no sense to reinvent the wheel for such multifaceted technologies – that is if you can reinvent any of it. That is why using frameworks that have been endorsed by dozens and dozens of developers all around the world is one of the most sensible approaches when it comes to interactive and rich <a href="https://www.imensosoftware.com/services/web-development/">web application development</a>.</p>

<p>Before moving any further, it is worth noting that web applications have both backends (the server side) and frontends (the client side). In this article, we will be discussing the top backend and frontend frameworks to use in 2019. Read on to learn more:

</p>



<h2>Backend Frameworks</h2>



<p>

From complete MVC frameworks to RESTful APIs, here is a look at some of the most authoritative backend frameworks in 2019.

</p>



<h3>Django</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/django-1.png" alt="Django" class="wp-image-2312" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/django-1.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/django-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/django-1-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Django is a python-based MVT or Model View Template framework used for web development and is used by some of the biggest names in the industry, that includes Instagram, Google, and YouTube. The framework’s primary marketing centerpiece is its batteries-included feature – which is a group of elements like messaging and authentication – that comes bundled in it. It is worth noting that Django follows the DRY and the Convention Over Configuration patterns and security is one of the things that it puts a lot of focus on. To guarantee security, Django either implements security features like preventing code execution within template layers in its framework or provide developers with tools and techniques they can use to build a secure website.

</p>



<h3>Rails </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rail.png" alt="Rails" class="wp-image-2313" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rail.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rail-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rail-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Rails, on the other hand, is a Ruby-based Model View Controller framework and is quite popular amongst developers. It is used by industry leaders such as Shopify, GitHub, and Hulu and is a beginner-friendly framework. And while the fact that a lot is going on behind the scenes in Rails is debated over its pros and cons, the framework helps beginners start web developing with relative ease. Rails has many useful gems – library-like dependencies that extend an application’s functionalities and help developers develop more efficiently and much faster. However, it is worth noting that Rails-developed applications require some effort to deploy and run in production environments, and the framework’s learning curve can sometimes steep especially when you dive a little bit deeper into it to unravel the magic that keeps it running.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h3>Express </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/express.png" alt="Express" class="wp-image-2319" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/express.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/express-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/express-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Thanks to Node.js’ skyrocketing popularity, Express has become a trending web development framework. Express is used by the likes of Uber, Accenture, and IBM and in other frameworks like Loopback, Kraken, and Sails. The framework prides itself as a fast, un-opinionated, and minimal framework considering that it provides some crucial framework functionalities without obscuring Node’s features while leveraging Node.js’ powerful performance. The framework is also quite elastic and supports both REST APIs and full applications. One of the framework’s main drawbacks is that it does not provide a defined way of how to get things done, at least for beginners.

</p>



<h3>Spring </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spring.png" alt="Spring " class="wp-image-2318" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spring.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spring-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spring-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Spring is a Java-based Model View Controller framework and is used by websites such as BillGuard, Wix, and TicketMaster. The framework possesses many sister projects that enhance its performance and allow developers to scale their organizations easily. Many web developers love this framework because it uses Java – one of the most common coding languages. However, if you do not know Java, the learning curve can be quite steep.&nbsp;

</p>



<h2>Frontend Frameworks </h2>



<h3>Angular </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/angular.png" alt="Angular" class="wp-image-2316" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/angular.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/angular-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/angular-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

This frontend framework’s focus is on building packed Single-Page applications. This rich framework makes it easy for developers to create client-side applications, and there is so much to learn and do in it. Angular 1.x initially used JavaScript before adopting Typescript – a superset of JavaScript – in later releases. However, it is considerably much bigger than other frameworks and isn’t that SEO-friendly, but it can still be optimized. The framework was developed by Google and is used by companies like PayPal, Microsoft, and Google itself.

</p>



<h3>Vue </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vue.png" alt="Vue" class="wp-image-2317" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vue.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vue-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vue-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

The latest rising star, Vue.js was started as a singular project but quickly grew to become one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks available today. There are so many cool things about Vue. The framework is so progressive that it even allows existing projects to adopt it, and things will still work without a hitch. Vue also comes with a component architecture, and its ecosystem can help developers build complete frontend applications.&nbsp;

</p>



<h3>Backbone </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/backbone-1.png" alt="Backbone" class="wp-image-2315" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/backbone-1.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/backbone-1-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/backbone-1-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

Backbone is a super lightweight frontend framework suitable for building rich Single-Page web applications. The framework follows a Model View pattern and partially implements the Model View Controller design. It is worth noting that this framework has only one core dependency, the Underscore Library and its ecosystem is so rich, that when added to Marionette and Mustache, it can allow developers to build complete client-side apps.

</p>



<h3>React </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/react.png" alt="React" class="wp-image-2314" srcset="https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/react.png 824w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/react-300x109.png 300w, https://www.imensosoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/react-768x280.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>

React isn’t a framework but a frontend library. However, a lot of developers consider it to be a framework, and it is usually compared in this context. This frontend library was the first to take on the component-based architecture that Vue and Singular and other adopted later on. Its dom makes dom manipulation simpler and much faster. Thanks to JSX syntax it uses, React is quite easy to pick up. It is worth noting that React can be used on both the client side or the server side. The library was developed and is being maintained by Facebook and is used by Instagram and Facebook.</p>



<p>The frameworks reviewed here are all flexible and are designed to cater to a variety of projects. A majority of these frameworks have substantially large communities, and with the number of developers out there being quite high, it shouldn’t be that hard to find a specialist to help you with your project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these frameworks are great; however, it is good to ask yourself one question – which of these web frameworks will best suit my project? The answer to this question will depend on your project requirements and your needs. So, take the time to consider each framework’s benefits and cons if you want to have an easier time choosing one that’ll save you both money and time in the long run.
