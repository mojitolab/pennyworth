                              Fraud costs money, reputation, and lower profits. It takes away your time and attention from your business. While discovering the fraud itself can be expensive, the fraud itself costs money and inflicts reputation damage, all these potentially lowering profits in the medium to long-term.

                              <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Valuation is of significant importance to companies especially in the wake of the changing global regulatory requirements and evolving market dynamics. Valuation is critical for financial reporting under Ind AS, benchmarking studies, statutory reporting of inbound and outbound investments, issuance of ESOPs etc. Often negotiations or internal management decisions, transactions, mergers, acquisitions, etc also necessitate valuation.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Valuation facilitates decision making by enabling us to determine whether the particular decision will be able to meet with our expectation. Valuation is needed in:

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Portfolio Management</strong>
                                <br>
                                Valuation is of significant importance for an active investor. Valuation plays a pivotal role in portfolio management for fundamental analysts, and a peripheral role for technical analysts.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Valuation in Acquisition Analysis</strong>
                                <br>
                                Precise valuation is equally important for both the bidding farm as well as the target firm as both parties aim at maximizing their potential gains. Analysts from both the involved parties need to consider synergy and the value of control to maximize profits for their respective parties.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Valuation in Corporate Finance</strong>
                                <br>
                                Valuation attains larger significance for small and medium enterprises when they seek capital infusion from investors. For large firms, their valuation decides the IPO rate when they decide to go public. While venture capitalists’ expected share in a target firm is estimated based their valuation of the firm, for big business houses valuation determines their decision on investment and borrowing.

                                <strong>Valuation of Company Shares </strong>
                                <br>
                                Valuation of the shares of a Company is needed for multi-fold reasons. Restructuring is the most common scenario here. In restructuring, a member of proprietary company offers a portion of the shares to another member.
                                <br>

                                <strong>Stock Valuation</strong>
                                <br>
                                Stock determines the intrinsic value of a share of a company and generates revenue. Stock valuation predicts the potential market prices for the investors to time their sales or purchase of investments.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is very important to know the current value of the stock. While for internal matters like MIS, financial statements for internal circulation, it is not compulsory to go for a valuation by professional. However, in case of creating charge on stock, merger transactions, etc. it requires valuation.

                                  Management Information System (MIS) refers to a host of systems that collect, organize, process and broadcast information related to a business. The data collected from different processes and operation wings are processed and analyzed before presenting to the management team in the form of standardized reports. These are reports generated to evaluate day-to-day activities of businesses or their problems that arise in the process of running the business smoothly. Some examples of MIS reports may include Cash Flow Statement, Profit and Loss Report, Expenses Report, Inventory Status Reports, etc.

                                  Meaningful insights from these reports help enterprise owners make decisions, and take stock of progress of their business and make necessary amendments or corrective measures to take the company forward. MIS reporting is a crucial tool that is used by businesses of all sizes and across industries.

                                                          The landscape of the Indian business is highly governed by family owned businesses. Most of these businesses continue to flourish to the next generation, while others scramble for success. It happens due to the fact that as companies move through various stages in their life cycle and build growth strategies to deal with changing business environments, the issue of leadership becomes critical and with it, the related issue of succession.
